Guessing Game
This is a simple Python program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program will prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, and it will display the number of attempts it took to win.


How to Use:
1. Clone this repository or download the guessing_game.py file.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where guessing_game.py is located.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:
   python guessing_game.py

5. The program will generate a random number between a specified range (you can customize this range in the code) and ask you to guess it.

6. Enter your guess when prompted.

7. The program will provide feedback, telling you if your guess is too high or too low. Continue guessing until you get it right.

8. Once you guess the correct number, the program will display the number of attempts it took to win the game.


Customize the Game:
You can customize the game by changing the following parameters in the code-

MIN_NUMBER and MAX_NUMBER: These variables determine the range of numbers within which the random number will be generated.

attempts: You can change the number of attempts allowed for guessing the correct number.
